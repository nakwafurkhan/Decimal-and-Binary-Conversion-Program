Decimal and Binary Conversion Program
Introduction
This program allows users to convert numbers between decimal and binary formats through a command-line interface. It operates in an interactive loop, enabling users to perform multiple conversions until they choose to exit the program. The program supports both positive and negative numbers and can identify whether the input is a decimal or binary number for conversion.

How to Use the Program
Start the Program: Launch the script in a Python environment.

Select Conversion Mode:

Type D to convert decimal numbers to binary.
Type B to convert binary numbers to decimal.
Type exit to terminate the program.
Enter Numbers:

In decimal mode, input decimal numbers to convert them to binary.
In binary mode, input binary numbers to convert them to decimal.
Typing exit in any mode will return to the main menu or close the program.
Program Structure
Infinite Loop
The program runs an infinite loop to continuously prompt the user for their preferred conversion mode or to exit the program. This loop ensures the program can handle multiple conversions during a single session.

Exit Condition
The program includes a condition to check if the user input is "exit". If true, the program prints a closing message and terminates, ending the session.

Mode Selection
Decimal to Binary Conversion Mode
Users enter "d" or "D" to select this mode.
The program enters a secondary loop, prompting for decimal numbers to convert to binary.
Conversion Process
Input Handling:

The user is prompted to input a decimal number.
If "exit" is entered, the program exits this loop and returns to the main menu.
Conversion Logic:

The program checks if the number is negative and converts it to its absolute value for processing.
The number is repeatedly divided by 2 to collect remainders, which are used to construct the binary representation.
If the original number was negative, the program adds a negative sign to the resulting binary string.
Binary to Decimal Conversion Mode
Users enter "b" or "B" to select this mode.
The program enters a secondary loop, prompting for binary numbers to convert to decimal.
Conversion Process
Input Handling:

The user is prompted to input a binary number.
If "exit" is entered, the program exits this loop and returns to the main menu.
Conversion Logic:

The program checks if the binary number is negative and removes the negative sign for calculation.
It reverses the binary string and converts it to a decimal number using the positional value system of binary digits.
If the original binary number was negative, the program applies a negative sign to the decimal result.
Handling Invalid Input
If the user inputs anything other than "D", "B", or "exit" at the main prompt, the program displays an error message and prompts for valid input. This ensures the user is guided toward providing acceptable commands.

Summary
This program is a practical tool for understanding the conversion between binary and decimal number systems. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface, supporting both positive and negative numbers. The program is a valuable resource for learning about number representation and conversion processes, illustrating how loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations can be used to perform complex tasks in programming.
